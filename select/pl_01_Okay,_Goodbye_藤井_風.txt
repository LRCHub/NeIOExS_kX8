Well I guess today is the perfect day
Gonna find me a really good life
Cause yesterday was the darkest day
Now that I gotta see the sunrise
Be the best man I could ever be
Each day's a precious gift to me
God lights my way
So that I can always feel I'm okay
Oh imma take a ride w me
Got my own energy
Baby I realized
That I am all I need
Oh yeah imma take ride w me
Stop playin' w me
I'll never love again unless it's true
Baby ain't coming back
Okay goodbye
Baby ain't coming back
Okay alright
Gonna be free at last
Okay goodbye
I think it's very nice
And I'm thankful for the way you blessed my life
Baby ain't coming back
So I guess it's time to go with a flow
Had to get the weight off my chest (my chest)
We don't have to fuss and fight anymore
I just wanna wish you the best (the best)
We were so good
And we tried the best we could
Let's just leave the rest
God lights our way
He's gonna take care of us anyway
Oh imma take a ride w me
Got my own energy
Baby I realized
That I am all I need (yes we got all we need)
Oh yeah imma take a ride w me
Go play w me
I never gonna love again unless it's true
Baby ain't coming back
Okay goodbye
Baby ain't coming back
Okay alright
Gonna be free at last
Okay goodbye
I think it's very nice
And I'm thankful for the way you blessed my life
Baby ain't
Coming back coming back
Coming back
And I'm never
Coming back coming back
Coming back I'm gone forever
Take anything from me
No I don't even care
Cuz I'm thankful for the way you blessed my life
Baby ain't coming back
Okay goodbye
Baby ain't coming back
Okay alright
Gonna be free at last
Okay goodbye
I think it's very nice
And I'm thankful for the way you blessed my life
And I'm thankful for the way you blessed my life
Yes I'm thankful for the way you blessed my life
Baby ain't coming back
